The awk command is a versatile text-processing tool commonly used in Unix and Linux environments. It allows you to process text files and manipulate data in various ways. awk operates on a line-by-line basis, parsing each line into fields and providing a range of operations to perform on those fields. Here are some common awk command examples:

1) Print specific columns:

bash
Copy code
$ awk '{print $1, $3}' filename.txt
2) This command prints the first and third columns of each line in the filename.txt file.

Filter lines based on a condition:

bash
Copy code
$ awk '$3 > 50' data.txt
 This command prints lines where the value in the third column is greater than 50.

3) Calculate the sum or average of a column:

$ awk '{sum += $2} END {print "Sum:", sum; print "Average:", sum/NR}' data.txt
This command calculates the sum and average of the values in the second column and prints the results at the end.

4) Concatenate fields:

$ awk '{print $1 $2}' data.txt
This command concatenates the first and second fields without a space between them.

5) Search and replace:

$ awk '{gsub("old_string", "new_string"); print}' data.txt

This command searches for "old_string" in each line and replaces it with "new_string" before printing the line.

6) Print lines matching a specific pattern:

$ awk '/pattern/' data.txt
This command prints all lines that contain "pattern."

7) Print the number of lines in a file:

$ awk 'END {print NR}' data.txt

This command prints the total number of lines in the data.txt file.
8) Field separator customization:

$ awk -F':' '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd

This command uses a colon (:) as the field separator to print the first and third fields from the /etc/passwd file.

9) Print lines between two patterns:

awk '/start_pattern/, /end_pattern/' data.txt

This command prints all lines between "start_pattern" and "end_pattern," inclusive.

10) Count occurrences of a specific pattern in a file:

$ awk '{count += gsub("pattern", "")} END {print "Count:", count}' data.txt

This command counts and prints the number of occurrences of "pattern" in the file.
